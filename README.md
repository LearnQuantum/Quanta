This project is built on Next.js and demonstrates a quantum annealing simulation interface. It leverages React hooks for state management and D3.js for dynamic data visualization.

## Project Overview

The Quantum Simulation Interface is designed to allow users to input simulation parameters which then generate steps of a quantum annealing process. Each step in the simulation is visualized using D3.js, providing a graphical representation of data points that change based on the simulation's progress and user feedback.

### Features

- **Dynamic Simulation Steps:** Users can input parameters that dynamically generate detailed steps of a quantum annealing simulation.
- **Graphical Visualization:** Each step is accompanied by a D3.js graph, which visualizes the simulation data, enhancing the user's understanding of each step's impact.
- **Interactive Feedback System:** The interface includes an interactive component where users can evaluate the accuracy of each simulation step and provide feedback. This feedback can influence the parameters and constraints of subsequent steps, making the simulation a dynamic and interactive experience.

### Technical Components

- **Custom UI Components:** The interface uses custom-built UI components like buttons, input fields, and text areas, ensuring a tailored user experience.
- **State Management with Hooks:** React hooks manage the state of the simulation parameters, steps, and user feedback, facilitating complex state interactions in a scalable way.
- **D3.js Integration:** The integration with D3.js allows for real-time data visualization, which is crucial for representing the dynamic nature of quantum simulations.

This project aims to provide an educational and interactive tool for users to explore and understand the principles of quantum annealing through direct manipulation and visualization of the simulation process.
